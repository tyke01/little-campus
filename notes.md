While looking for child care for their then 2.5-year-old son, she quickly realized there was a shortage of quality care in the Etobicoke area.

Soon after, Tami was pregnant with her second child, a daughter. Tami’s mission was clear: to create an early childhood education & daycare centre whose quality of care, highly trained educators, and unique programming were unrivalled in Toronto.

In her spare time, Christina keeps busy with balloon arrangements and crafting.
