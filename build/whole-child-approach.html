            <p class="mt-5">
                At The Little Campus, we&apos;ve created a warm, safe and loving
                environment for our children — a space where the uniqueness of each
                child is respected and supported. <br />

                From babies to preschoolers, we encourage children to grow and learn
                using the Whole Child Approach. This teaching strategy uses
                social-emotional learning to create the best learning outcomes for
                all levels and stages of development

          <h1 class="py-5 text-gray-900 font-bold text-xl">What is the Whole Child Approach</h1>
          <p>
            The objective of the Whole Child Approach is to ensure a
            child&apos;s overall development, and help improve each
            student&apos;s academic performance as they grow. The approach aims
            to provide all children with the assistance and structure for
            attaining long-term success in all areas of their lives. When
            children of all ages are encompassed by the Whole Child concepts
            (see below), they are able to learn to the best of their ability,
            becoming well-functioning individuals

        <div>
          <h1 class="py-5 text-gray-900 font-bold text-xl">The Five Pillars</h1>
          <p>
            The teacher&apos;s role in the Whole Child Approach is to encourage
            students to grow in every area. A “whole child” is curious,
            creative, caring, empathetic and confident.
            <br />
            <p class="my-3">There are five key pillars to the Whole Child:</p>
          </p>

            <h2 class="py-5 text-gray-900 font-bold text-xl">1.Healthy</h2>
            <p>
              It is crucial to educate children on the importance of making
              healthy decisions in their everyday lives. Whether it&apos;s
              eating the right foods, engaging in regular exercise, or
              practicing mindfulness, we put a strong importance on your
              child&apos;s overall health at TLC. From infants and babies to
              toddlers and preschoolers, we provide the following
              age-appropriate activities to encourage children to practice
              healthy living every day:
            </p>

            <div>
              <h2 class="py-5 text-gray-500 font-bold text-xl">Yoga & Mindfulness</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                    Yoga creates a balance between strength and flexibility in
                    little developing bodies. It helps them grow strong while
                    maintaining the flexibility they were born with. Even at the
                    baby stage, the poses and stretches for infants aid in digestion
                    and help relieve constipation, gas and colic.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As children develop, yoga is a great way to continue
                    strengthening their bodies, calm their minds, and help them feel
                    relaxed. Yoga also helps to improve sleeping patterns — both in
                    duration and frequency — and encourages sleeping well at night
                    too. Playful yoga songs and activities make the experience fun
                    for little ones of all ages and stages!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Mindfulness and meditation are introduced at the toddler and
                    pre-school stage, and the benefits are endless. Meditation can
                    improve your child&apos;s ability to focus, learn,
                    self-regulate, elevate mood, and reduce stress and anxiety. The
                    children at TLC practice meditation by learning breathing
                    techniques, positive thinking and relaxation.

                    We expose children to physical activities that are both fun and
                    age appropriate — both indoors and out! The Little Campus has
                    over 5,000 square feet of outdoor space. We believe in as much
                    outdoor and fresh air exposure as possible for children of all
                    ages.

                    Infants aged 0-12 months need plenty of opportunities for free
                    movement, in a safe environment. At TLC, we&apos;ve created
                    areas that encourage your child to explore and develop skills
                    like reaching, tummy time, rolling, sitting up, crawling,
                    pulling up and walking.

                <p>
                    Toddlers and children aged 2-5 years need plenty of time to run
                    around and play. Children at TLC engage in both indoor and
                    outdoor free play, community walks, dance, gymnastics, ball
                    sports and organized, non-competitive games.

                    We offer lunch and snacks by Toronto&apos;s leading healthy

                <br />
                <p>
                    Real Food for Real Kids&apos; mission is to provide children
                    with nutritious meals and snacks, inspiring future generations
                    to make healthier choices every day. Their foods contain no
                    artificial anything, and all produce and farming is local to
                    Ontario. Their menus are always developed with healthy bodies
                    and delicious flavours in mind — trust me, my family has tasted
                    it all, and it&apos;s definitely kid-approved!

                <p>
                    At TLC, we foster family-style eating — where everyone sits
                    around a table trying new foods together. No child is forced to
                    eat anything they don&apos;t like, but we will encourage them to
                    try different foods at their own pace. Truth be told, most
                    don&apos;t need much encouragement, especially when they see
                    their friends digging in. It&apos;s truly amazing to see the
                    children make healthy choices!

                <p>
                    When it comes to infants, we know that new little tummies need
                    consistency. That&apos;s why we feed our littlest ones exactly
                    what their parents have provided us. Whether breast milk or
                    formula, we make sure to stick with what is being fed at home.

                <br />
                <p>
                    Please note that The Little Campus is a nut-free facility. As
                    such, there are absolutely no nuts permitted inside the
                    building. We kindly ask that families are mindful of what they
                    are feeding their child prior to coming to school, and diligent
                    about keeping children with food allergies safe. For example, if
                    your child had peanut butter for breakfast, please ensure that
                    they have washed their hands, and that there are no remnants on
                    their bodies or clothing. In cases where a little one in your
                    child&apos;s room has additional and/or different food
                    allergies, we will ask for your cooperation in refraining from
                    bringing those items into the classroom as well.

              <p>
                  A child must feel safe and secure in their surroundings in order
                  to engage in learning. This starts by encouraging harmonious
                  relationships with their peers. Social learning at TLC begins
                  right at the baby stage all the way through to pre-school. Our
                  programming uses elements of the Ontario Ministry of Education's
                  model of “How learning Happens.”
              </p>
              <br />

                  It is also important that children feel a sense of belonging and
                  well-being. This refers to a sense of connectedness to others, an
                  individual&apos;s experiences of being valued, of forming
                  relationships with others, and making contributions as part of a
                  group, a community or the natural world.

                  Well-being addresses the importance of physical and mental health
                  and wellness. It incorporates capacities such as self-care, sense
                  of self, and the ability to self-regulate.

                  Classroom safety and school environment is of the utmost
                  importance at The Little Campus. Each room at TLC has been
                  designed to ensure the physical safety of all children. We pay
                  attention to every little detail, like locking and securing heavy
                  furniture to the wall, and making sure free-standing furniture is
                  low enough to guarantee no child will go unnoticed — even during a
                  game of hide-and-seek! We maintain sanitary and clutter-free
                  classrooms, always.

                  We help engage students in learning through play. We implement
                  interactive projects and creative lessons taught and facilitated
                  by teachers — but often inspired by what the children are
                  interested in.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                  Play is essentially governed by the needs and wishes of the child.
                  It is through play that children develop the use of all their
                  senses. It is a forum through which a child practices creativity,
                  socialization, life skills and cognitive development. It is
                  through play that we see the very important expression of all
                  emotions.

                  Your child will engage in a variety of hands-on activities.
                  Whether it&apos;s getting our hands messy (literally and
                  figuratively!) with paint or sitting outside under a tree for
                  storytime, we ensure the children are always stimulated in
                  creative ways. Increased interest and motivation help enhance
                  student engagement and participation, which are key factors to
                  classroom learning.

                  When children are able to explore the world around them with their
                  natural curiosity and exuberance, they are fully engaged. Through
                  this type of inquisitive play at TLC, your little one will develop
                  skills such as problem-solving, creative thinking, and innovating
                  — which are essential for learning and success in school and
                  beyond.

                  Expression or communication (to be heard as well as to listen) can
                  take many different forms. Through their bodies, words, and use of
                  materials, children will develop capacities for increasingly
                  complex communication. We will give ample opportunities for
                  students to explore materials that support their creativity,
                  problem-solving and mathematical behaviours. Language-rich
                  environments support growing communication skills, which are
                  foundational for literacy.

                  At TLC, we believe that support is key to an overall successful
                  experience at school. That is why our Director has been certified
                  through the renowned Child&apos;s Behaviour Certification Program,
                  through The Early Years by Sharyn Timerman.

                  She based the program&apos;s philosophy on the belief that
                  children are a privilege and a gift that the family and community
                  can appreciate. She believes it is critical to motivate and
                  inspire children while setting rules and guidelines, helping them
                  acquire habits, goals, and knowledge that lead to becoming
                  well-functioning adults. The goal is to celebrate individuality
                  and to help children become independent thinkers. Lastly, the
                  mission of this program is to support the notion that all children
                  can be taught to do good in the world simply for the sake of doing
                  good.

                  When it comes to infants and babies, we pay close attention to
                  each baby&apos;s cues. We very quickly learn when your baby is
                  trying to communicate that they&apos;re happy, sad or in need of
                  something. We take a very individualized approach to make sure all
                  babies are heard even when they can&apos;t speak. We know that
                  infants and babies require lots of stimulation, sensory
                  activities, cuddles and sleep. We provide it all, and we even have
                  a few “Baby Whisperers” on staff!

                  As language develops, we encourage the children to use their
                  voice, share their thoughts and opinions, and ask questions. Our
                  goal for children of all ages is to feel confident, heard, and
                  accepted within the classroom, and by their teachers and friends.

                  At the child&apos;s individual level, teachers will offer rich
                  learning experiences through literacy, numeracy, social education,
                  the arts, math, science and physical education. The Little Campus
                  has its very own reading program, created by owner Tami Zuckerman.
                  Tami holds a Bachelor of Education degree, and is specially
                  certified in Early Literacy.

                  It is important to note that while children will be challenged at
                  their individual level, we only promote learning that is positive,
                  age appropriate and fun. There is no room for frustration — a
                  child will never be pushed beyond their limits. For example, a
                  child who is not showing signs of reading readiness will be
                  brought up to speed at their own pace with emergent literacy
                  activities. Making sure a child is ready for the next level in any
                  subject is key to their future academic success. It is vital that
                  we motivate any child that is demonstrating signs of frustration.
                  We do this to alleviate the risk of turning them off of a given
                  subject.
